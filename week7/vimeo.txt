Vimeo is one of favorite sites on the web.  The style of the website really fits with the more creative aspect that the vimeo community thrives on.  The design immediately catches your eye with the illustrations they use from users.  The design while nice loking is also very simple.

The navigation of vimeo and the structure of the site I also like.  The content is easy to see and is available right from the start of the website.  They have very well defined sections that can easily get you where you need to go.  The couch mode is once section that I do enjoy alot.  You just set back and watch as the different videos play automatically.
