<h2>Critique of Panic.com</h2>
<p>The first thing I notice about panic.com is the simplistic nature of the website. Even the logo for the company is simplistic. This choice in design is obivious for the market that they are targeting. Apple is known for the simplistic nature of their designs for their hardware and with a focus of these apps the company is providing is specifically for Apple products, this design would be favorable to users of those platforms. </p>
<p>The navigation through the site is also every simplisitic. The buttons on the front page are big and very noticable. For the pages below the index page, there is a very clear way to get back to the home screen. I wish there were links to the other products though, so I wouldn't have to always comback to the main page to look at the other products of the company offers.</p>
<p>Lastly, the content of panic.com is very well done. Each page for each product is full of content and informative content at that. Panic.com does a great job of clearly showing what each product does, the feature lists are prominently displayed, and the screenshots do a great job to show what the features can do. One problem I do have with the content is the blog. The last entry was from December 12th and it has always been a pet peeve of mine when a blog is not kept up to date (though onely a month and a half old is better than some others do).</p>
