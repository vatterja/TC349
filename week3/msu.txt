Critique of MSU Homepage

The MSU current homepage is much better than the previous adaptations of the website in my opinion.  The slider on the front page is very informative and really livens up the page.  I did not like the static nature of the old website.  The way the main body is broken up really does help highlight the different areas and makes the website much more readable.

The new navigation that they updated on MSU's website is really the difference maker.  The navigation bar is prominent and easy to read.  The dropdown menus for each of the main buttons is easy to naviagte without much issue with mousing over. The "quick links" underneath the main navigation bar is a nice touch too.  It makes it easy to get to what you need quickly and without the hassle of searching through the navigation to find it.
