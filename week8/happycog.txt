My first impression of the HappyCog website was that it is very pleasing to the eyes.  The pastel color scheme that is used is done very well to make it look warming to the user.  The white text with the black in the header pops really well and immediately catches your eye.  This effect works well with the navigation bar because the user will always see clearly on where to navigate through the site.

The navigation of the site is also interesting.  They use a scroll effect to go down the page.  The entire website is on this one page.  The biggest benefit for this effect is the navigation bar stays with you are all times.  This is an excellent touch that makes it much easier to navigate through a single page website.  Personally, I like the effect, but I can also see how it would be confusing to some less web-savvy users.
