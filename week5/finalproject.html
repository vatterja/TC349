<p>For my final project I want to work on my busniess website. I want to have a clean website without much to distract the user from the services that I plan to offer. I want the home page to have descriptions to the services and links from there to the relate service. I am not a big fan of super overly complicated websites, so a simple streamlined approach will be what I plan to do.</p>

<p>First thing I did was go through and find all the seperate pages I could find. The pages are: Home, About, Services, Internet Consulting, Computer Consulting, Data Services, and Conact. Once this was narrowed down, I wrote all the pages on cards with a short description. Once I had this, I gave the cards to my three roommates (2 females, 1 male) and asked them to sort these cards into categories they believed they fit into. I did not give them any indication that this was for a particular website.</p>
<p>The results themelves are fairly boring. In doing a streamlined approach to the site that I want, the categories were easy to fill out. Each person thought that all the services should be put together and interesting enough that user1 again thought that the home and about pages should be the same category.</p>
