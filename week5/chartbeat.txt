When I first went to chartbeat I was a little confused.  I was trying to figure out what the company is about.  Obviously, the company is assuming that you know what they are about when you go to the site.  Everything is very ambiguous in the writing, almost like they are trying to say what the company is about in very simple terms.

As for the design aspect, I didn’t like it at all.  The constant scrolling to get to the bottom and actually navigate the site, without clicking on the areas that I scrolled through which are basically ads for their services, was very annoying.  Once you get past the initial pages, the design is quite nice.  The content is set in the main area and left bar appears depending on the page.

In the end, chartbeat just seems like a site that is trying to much to wow the user.  I would much rather have preferred a more simplistic look, that is easy to navigate and easy to get the information I want.
