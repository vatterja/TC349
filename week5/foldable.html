<p>First thing I did was go through and find all the seperate pages I could find. The pages are: Home, About, Blog, Blog Archives, Conact, Feedback, Gift Certifigates, Create a Foldable, Terms of Service, and Privacy policy. Once this was narrowed down, I wrote all the pages on cards with a short description. Once I had this, I gave the cards to my three roommates (2 females, 1 male) and asked them to sort these cards into categories they believed they fit into. I did not give them any indication that this was for a particular website.</p>
<p>The results themelves are fairly interesting. All of my roommates disagreed with me that the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service are their own categories and not the same as the about page. I considered that the same cateogory due to the fact that the Privacy policy and the Terms of Service are specific to this company and should be apart of the about category. Other than that, things are pretty consisent, expect with the argument of User1 that the Home and About pages are the same category.</p>
