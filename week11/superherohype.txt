The site that I choose was superherohype.com.  I go this site regularly on my phone moreso than on my computer.  The reason for this is their mobile site.  Their mobile site is very streamlined and made perfectly for mobile devices.  The new feed is very easy to see and is the main content for the site.  It makes it easy to check on the news of the day and it doesn’t just show the title, which I like too.

The news slideshow is also done very well.  It scales right to my phone screen and the fade rotation is very smooth.  The menu is located at the top in a very prominent place and the dropdown they use to show the navigation is nice because it uses less screen real estate.  Overall it is one of my favorite examples of a mobile site done right.
