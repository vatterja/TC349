My first reaction to the United Pixelworkers website was busy.  The tile effect that the website uses while effective the way of keeping the design regardless of the size of the screen.  The moving tiles when you adjust the screen size are impressive.  But overall I don’t like the layout.  Everything is just presented on the screen in a way that doesn’t let you focus on one thing.

The color scheme for the site is nice.  I like the orange, dark grey, grey, and blue.  They mix very well and really pop out of the screen.  The layout for the non-gallery pages work and the text is very prominent and easy to read.

Overall, I think I don’t like the site that much because it is very in your face.  Everything is big and boxy and really makes it hard to focus on what they are selling.
