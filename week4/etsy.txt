The first thing I notice when I go to esty is the hand picked items.  I think it was clever of them to have this feature as it really showcases what etsy is about. Being "Handpicked Items", the user is shown that this is a website that shows off boths its community and esty's care for said community.

As for the design, I like it.  It is very clear where you can go to sign up, shop, and easily find your cart when you are shopping.  The colors are relaxed and fit with the overall style of the website.  The different sections for the site are seperated nicely and easy to see.  Lastly, the one thing that is always important to me is the availability of the help.  Etsy has a link in the top right hand corner of its site that is always there and not hiding.
