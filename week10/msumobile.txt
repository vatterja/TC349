To start off this critique, I have to mention that I have a Windows Phone 8.  The mobile MSU site doesn’t work well Windows phones.  This is par for the course for most things I realize, but that is a strike against MSU’s mobile site.  Now, using a mobile emulator, I got the site up to its full potential and I do like it.  The colors that the site employs are great, and I really like the dark green icons.  They do a good job of describing what the button is without having to look at the text.  I also like how you can customize the home screen to the way you want it.  This is a great feature that I would use on my phone (if it worked for my phone of course).

The navigation for the site is also done very well.  The breadcrumb trail navigation works well with mobile experience and makes it easy to get all the way back home.  The search function works great too.  Overall the experience is very well done and I would recommend it to any MSU student.
